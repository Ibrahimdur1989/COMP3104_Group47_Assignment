SDLC means Software Development Life Cycle. It has many steps like planning, 
designing, coding, testing, and deployment. DevOps makes this process faster 
because of automation and continuous testing. I understand now how CI/CD makes
updates easier and helps teams work better together. It's one of the most usefull
things I learned in this course.
