Importance of DevOps in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):
DevOps plays a crucial role in modern software development by bridging the gap
between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. It emphasizes collaboration,
automation, and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) to enhance software 
quality and speed.

Hereâ€™s why DevOps is important in the SDLC:
- Faster Delivery and Deployment:
DevOps automates key stages like integration, testing, and deployment, allowing teams
to release updates and new features more quickly and frequently.
- Improved Collaboration and Communication:
It breaks down silos between developers, testers, and operations teams, promoting a 
culture of shared responsibility and transparency throughout the project lifecycle.
- Enhanced Quality and Reliability:
Continuous testing and monitoring help identify and fix issues early, ensuring more 
stable and reliable software releases.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):
DevOps ensures code changes are integrated regularly, tested automatically, and 
deployed smoothly, reducing risks associated with big-bang releases.
