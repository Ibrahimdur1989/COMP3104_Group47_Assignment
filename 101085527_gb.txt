George Brown College is one of the best colleges in Toronto. It has three campuses: Casa Loma, 
St. James, and Waterfront. The college focuses a lot on hands-on projects and real experience 
which helps student learn better. I like that every semester we build real projects and work like
 in a company. I'm in my fifth semester in Computer Programming and Analysis program.
