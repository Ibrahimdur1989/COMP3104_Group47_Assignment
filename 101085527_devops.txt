In this course I learned how DevOps connects developwes and operations together. We used 
GitHub Actions to test and deploy our code automatically which makes work easier. Also I 
learned about Docker and Jenkins and how they help in CI/CD. For me, DevOps is about saving
 time, teamwork, and always improving the project.
